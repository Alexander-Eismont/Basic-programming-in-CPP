### Address

In this assignment, you will read addresses from a file and output them to another file in a different format.

You are given a file `in.txt`, which contains `N` addresses. The number `N` comes first in the file. After the number `N` there are `N` blocks of 4 lines each. Each block consists of the following lines: city name, street name, house number, apartment number.

The program's task is to read addresses from the `in.txt` file and output them to the `out.txt` file in a different format and in reverse order. Don't forget to print the number of addresses at the beginning.

Address output format: `<city name>, <street name>, <house number>, <apartment number>`.
