### Task 1. Shapes. Number of sides
In this assignment, you will build the first simple class hierarchy for a given problem domain.

The subject area looks like this: there is a figure entity. There are two types of shapes: triangle and quadrilateral. A figure has a number of sides. For an unknown figure, we will assume that this quantity is equal to zero. A triangle has three sides, a quadrilateral has four sides. For any figure, we want to know the number of its sides, **but we should not be able to change the number of sides for a given figure from the outside**.

Task: design and implement classes that describe the subject area. Demonstrate how they work: create one instance of each class and print information about the number of its sides to the console.
