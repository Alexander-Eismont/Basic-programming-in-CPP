### 1. The simplest project
In this task you need to create a simple project using CMake.

Create a CMake project `my_first_cmake_project`, which will contain the executable program `my_first_cmake_program`. The program should ask for the user's name and greet him.

### 2. The project is more complex
This assignment involves creating a more complex project using CMake.

You need to build and run the program [from the previous homework](https://github.com/Alexander-Eismont/Netology-Ch3-Basic-programming-in-CPP/tree/main/lesson-05/3_Class_Hierarchy) using CMake.

After assembly, check that everything works correctly for you.
