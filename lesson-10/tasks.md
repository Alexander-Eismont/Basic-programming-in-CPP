### 1. Static library
In this task you need to create a static library and use it.

Create a `Greeter` class that defines one `greet` method that takes a string as input and returns a greeting string with the value of the string that was passed to it.

Place this class in a static library and use it from a console application to greet the user when they enter their name.

### 2. Dynamic library
In this task you need to create a dynamic library and use it.

Create a `Leaver` class that defines one `leave` method that takes a string as input and returns a string saying goodbye to the value of the string that was passed to it.

Place this class in a dynamic library and use it from a console application to say goodbye to the user who enters his name.

### 3. CMake dynamic library
In this task you need to create a dynamic library and use it using CMake.

Create a `Leaver` class that defines one `leave` method that takes a string as input and returns a string saying goodbye to the value of the string that was passed to it.

Place this class in a dynamic library and use it from a console application to say goodbye to the user who enters his name.

### 4*. Class hierarchy in DLLs, VC++ projects
In this assignment, you will create a more complex dynamic library using Visual C++ projects.

Take the class hierarchy from [the previous assignment](https://github.com/Alexander-Eismont/Basic-programming-in-CPP/tree/main/lesson-05/3_Class_Hierarchy) and place it in a dynamic library. Your console application should only contain code for communicating with the user and using classes from the library.

Demonstrate the functionality of your library.

### 5*. Class hierarchy in DLL and CMake
In this task you need to build your dynamic library using CMake.

Take the sources from [the previous task](https://github.com/Alexander-Eismont/Basic-programming-in-CPP/tree/main/lesson-05/3_Class_Hierarchy) and assemble them into a working program using CMake.

Demonstrate the functionality of your program.
